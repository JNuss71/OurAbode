We are a group of college freshmen who are working on a project that allows an individual to customize their home systems which includes:

-custom lighting.
-individualized music preferences.
-even their optimal toasting time on their toaster.
-locking systems for doors which is only unlocked by certain people.

Each person will have a card which stores their ID which is then used to call the information relating to said ID which is used to set 
their appliances to their prefered setting.

Example:

The father of the household prefers the kitchen lighting to be dim and his toast almost burnt while listening to jazz before leaving 
for work. 
The daughter of the household, who gets up a few hours after the father likes the lights as bright as they can be with very lightly 
toasted toast and listening to Justin Beiber on the radio.

Lets say that the son has come back after 4 years of college and is new to this new technology. He does not know his prefered lighting 
or how long to toast his toast. Luckily, the toaster and lights will adapt to his preference. Both will start at base settings with High
and low and choose a random value inbetween the range. For example, the toaster's miniumum toasting time starts at 30 seconds and the 
maximum starts at 300 seconds, a random time inbetween the two will be chosen for the son to experience and then he can rate the toast.
Does he prefer it to be crispier? The toaster will increase maximum time and minimum time by a few seconds. Does he prefer it to be 
lighter? the toaster will decrease the maximum time and minimum time by a few seconds. Maybe he doesn't know and has neutral feelings,
the toaster will decrease the maximum time and increase the minimum time to close in on his prefered toast time. Eventually it will find
the perfect amount of seconds for his toast to be toasted.

Repeat same thing with Lighting brightness.
